# Phase 2 — Backend Integration (ServiceNow Wiring)

> **Goal of Phase 2:** Swap every mock in `src/services/api.js` for a real HTTP call to the SugboClean ServiceNow REST API at `https://dev375738.service-now.com/api/1986056/sugboclean_api`. Replace fake admin auth with Basic Auth credential capture. Handle the real response shapes (display values + `sys_id`s). Ship a fully functional, data-driven SugboClean.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 1 is complete and the DoD in `PHASE_1_DESIGN.md` §E is met. Specifically:

- Every page reads data only through `src/services/api.js`
- No component imports from `src/mocks/` directly
- `AuthContext` gates all `/admin/*` routes

If those two rules held, **Phase 2 should not touch any page component**.

---

## Part A — What Phase 2 Must Deliver

1. All 22 endpoints in fluent folder §5 wired and callable from the frontend
2. Real Basic Auth for admin users (session-scoped, never committed)
3. The server-generated `SC-YYYY-NNNN` report code replaces the fake Phase-1 code generator
4. Admin status updates persist in ServiceNow (resident tracker reflects the change after refetch)
5. Missed-pickup photo uploads land in the `u_photo` field on the Report record
6. Reminder email subscriptions create rows in the Reminder Subscription table
7. Charts in AdminAnalyticsPage render against live report data, not mocks
8. The resident `/schedule` page is the single entry point for barangay-specific info — selecting a barangay dynamically loads schedule, assigned hauler, and route stops in one view. The old `/haulers` and `/route-map` resident pages are removed.
9. Every network call is observable — request/response shape handling, error states, retry where appropriate
10. Environment variables drive the instance URL + credentials (no hardcoded secrets)

---

## Part B — Environment & Secrets Setup

### B.1 — Environment variables

Create `.env.local` at project root (already in `.gitignore`):

```env
VITE_SN_INSTANCE=https://dev375738.service-now.com
VITE_SN_API_BASE=/api/1986056/sugboclean_api
VITE_SN_USERNAME=admin
VITE_SN_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

> Prefix is `VITE_` if the NowSDK bundler is Vite-based. Check `now.dev.mjs` — if it's webpack/CRA, use `REACT_APP_` instead. Adjust imports accordingly.

### B.2 — Constants module

In `src/utils/constants.js` add:

```javascript
export const API = {
  instance: import.meta.env.VITE_SN_INSTANCE,
  base: import.meta.env.VITE_SN_API_BASE,
  url: `${import.meta.env.VITE_SN_INSTANCE}${import.meta.env.VITE_SN_API_BASE}`,
};
```

### B.3 — ServiceNow CORS check

The CORS rule for `https://dev375738.service-now.com` is already configured. If running `npm run dev` on a different origin (e.g. a standalone Vite server on `http://localhost:5173`), an additional CORS rule must be added in ServiceNow for that origin. Ask the ServiceNow admin to add it, or use the NowSDK's built-in dev proxy (preferred).

---

## Part C — Milestone Breakdown

### Milestone 2.1 — Real HTTP Layer in `services/api.js` (Day 1)

**Outcome:** The stub file from Phase 1 becomes a real API client. Page components untouched.

- [ ] Replace the `delay()` stub helper with a real `request()` helper:

  ```javascript
  import { API } from '../utils/constants';
  import { getAuthHeader } from '../context/AuthContext';

  async function request(path, { method = 'GET', body } = {}) {
    const res = await fetch(`${API.url}${path}`, {
      method,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Accept: 'application/json',
        Authorization: getAuthHeader(),
      },
      body: body ? JSON.stringify(body) : undefined,
    });

    if (!res.ok) {
      const err = await res.json().catch(() => ({}));
      throw new ApiError(res.status, err?.error?.message || res.statusText);
    }

    return res.json();
  }
  ```

- [ ] Implement each of the 22 endpoint functions from CLAUDE.md §5 on top of `request()`. Keep the **exact same function signatures** as Phase 1 stubs.
- [ ] Create a custom `ApiError` class with `status` + `message` for callers to branch on (401 → re-prompt login, 404 → not-found state, etc.)
- [ ] Delete `src/mocks/mockData.js` (or keep it gated behind `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` for Storybook/tests — team call)

**Acceptance:** Open the Network tab, click around every page, confirm real calls hit `/api/1986056/sugboclean_api/...` with the expected method + path + payload.

---

### Milestone 2.2 — Response Shape Alignment (Day 2)

**Outcome:** Reference fields (barangay, hauler) display correctly without breaking `sys_id`-based operations.

Per CLAUDE.md §9 note 5: ServiceNow returns reference fields with **both** raw `sys_id` and display value. Example for a report:

```json
{
  "sys_id": "def456",
  "report_code": "SC-2026-0001",
  "barangay": {
    "value": "abc123",          // sys_id — used for updates
    "display_value": "Lahug"    // human name — used for rendering
  },
  "missed_date": "2026-04-13",
  "status": "Pending"
}
```

- [ ] Add a `normalizeRecord()` helper in `src/services/api.js` that flattens `{ value, display_value }` into two fields: `barangay_id` and `barangay` (display). Apply to every GET response so pages can just render `report.barangay` and send `report.barangay_id` on update.
- [ ] Audit every page that reads a reference field. Pages that still use the old flat mock shape work unchanged. Pages that broke: fix them now.
- [ ] Key spots to re-verify:
  - ReportsTable — `report.barangay` rendering
  - ScheduleChecker — barangay dropdown uses `sys_id` as `<option value>`; resolves hauler + route stops via their `barangay_id`
  - All CRUD managers (admin) — form dropdowns for reference fields

**Acceptance:** No `[object Object]` appears anywhere in the UI. Reference fields render as human names and submit as `sys_id`s.

---

### Milestone 2.3 — Real Admin Authentication (Day 2)

**Outcome:** Admin login actually authenticates against ServiceNow. Bad credentials show an error.

- [ ] Rewrite `AuthContext`:
  - `login(username, password)` computes `Basic ${btoa(`${username}:${password}`)}`, then test-calls `GET /barangays` with that header. On 2xx → store header in memory + `sessionStorage`. On 401 → throw "Invalid credentials".
  - `getAuthHeader()` reads from memory / sessionStorage
  - `logout()` clears both
  - On app boot, hydrate from `sessionStorage` so an F5 doesn't kick the admin out
- [ ] `LoginPage` → call `login()`, surface the error from the 401 path
- [ ] `PrivateRoute` stays the same — it only reads `isAdmin`

**Security notes:**
- Never log the Authorization header (add a lint rule or code-review checklist)
- Session storage is cleared on tab close — acceptable for the pilot. For production, the LGU should move to OAuth
- The `.env.local` password is a **developer** credential, not end-user. Real admins type theirs into the LoginPage

**Acceptance:** Wrong password → inline error; correct password → redirect to dashboard; refresh → still logged in; close tab + reopen → logged out.

---

### Milestone 2.4 — Report Submission with Real Code Generation (Day 3)

**Outcome:** The server-generated `SC-YYYY-NNNN` code replaces the Phase-1 random one.

The Business Rule `Generate Report Code` on `x_1986056_sugbocle_report` auto-sets `u_report_code` on insert (see `src/fluent/generated/server-development/business-rule/sys_script_7ca7067893580310153ffdc9dd03d6bc.now.ts`). The REST endpoint's response includes it.

- [ ] Update `createReport()` to expect this response shape:
  ```json
  { "result": { "sys_id": "...", "report_code": "SC-2026-0042" } }
  ```
- [ ] `MissedPickupForm` success modal reads `report_code` from the real response (no more frontend generation)
- [ ] Remove the Phase-1 `generateReportCode()` helper from `utils/helpers.js`
- [ ] Edge case: if the server returns a `report_code` that's shorter/longer than expected, just display whatever came back — never truncate/reformat

**Acceptance:** Submit a real report → receive a server-issued code → fetch that code via `/track` → see the record the server created.

---

### Milestone 2.5 — Photo Upload (Day 3–4)

**Outcome:** Optional photos on missed-pickup reports land in the `u_photo` field.

ServiceNow attachments go to a separate endpoint: `/api/now/attachment/file`. Two-step flow:

1. Create the report via `POST /reports` → get `sys_id`
2. Upload the photo via `POST /api/now/attachment/file?table_name=x_1986056_sugbocle_report&table_sys_id={sys_id}&file_name=photo.jpg` with the raw file bytes and correct `Content-Type`

- [ ] Add `uploadReportPhoto(reportSysId, file)` to `services/api.js`
- [ ] In `MissedPickupForm`:
  - On submit: step 1 → step 2 (if photo present) → show success modal
  - Show a simple upload progress indicator
  - Max file size 5 MB; validate client-side; also handle the ServiceNow 413 response
  - Accept only image MIME types
- [ ] Display uploaded photo when admin views a report — use the attachment URL returned from ServiceNow

**Acceptance:** Submit a report with a JPG → open the report record in ServiceNow admin → confirm attachment is present.

---

### Milestone 2.6 — Admin Status Updates Persist (Day 4)

**Outcome:** Flipping Pending → In Progress → Resolved survives a page refresh.

- [ ] `updateReportStatus(sysId, status)` now hits `PATCH /reports/{sys_id}/status` with `{ "status": "In Progress" }`
- [ ] On success: re-fetch the report list OR optimistically update the local state (pick one and be consistent)
- [ ] Remove the Phase-1 pub/sub store — real refresh drives updates now. **However:** the resident tracker needs near-real-time updates. Use a polling strategy:
  - When the tracker page is open, poll `GET /reports/{report_code}` every 10s
  - Stop polling when the page unmounts
  - Show a subtle "Last updated 3s ago" indicator
- [ ] (Optional Phase 3 / 4) Replace polling with ServiceNow WebSockets if feasible

**Acceptance:** Admin changes status → resident tracker updates within ~10 seconds without a manual refresh.

---

### Milestone 2.7 — CRUD Managers Wired to Real API (Day 5)

**Outcome:** Schedule / Hauler / Route Stop / Waste Item CRUD actually persists. These managers remain on the **admin side** — residents no longer have dedicated Hauler or Route pages; both surface inside the merged Schedule page (see Milestone 2.10).

- [ ] ScheduleManager → `createSchedule`, `updateSchedule`, `deleteSchedule`
- [ ] HaulerManager → `createHauler`, `updateHauler`, `deleteHauler`
- [ ] RouteStopManager → `createRouteStop`, `updateRouteStop`, `deleteRouteStop`
- [ ] WasteItemManager → `createWasteItem`, `updateWasteItem`, `deleteWasteItem`
- [ ] After every mutation: refetch the list (keeps the page simple; optimize later if slow)
- [ ] Confirmation dialog before DELETE (nondestructive UX)
- [ ] Form validation: required fields match CLAUDE.md §4 table schemas (max lengths, choice values)

**Acceptance:** Create a hauler in admin HaulerManager and assign it to Lahug → open the resident `/schedule` page, select Lahug → the new hauler appears in the schedule page's hauler panel → edit a route stop in admin → refresh the schedule page → the updated stop shows in the route section → delete → gone.

---

### Milestone 2.8 — Reminder Subscription (Day 5)

**Outcome:** The subscribe form on the Schedule page creates a real Reminder Subscription record.

- [ ] `subscribeReminder(data)` calls `POST /reminders` with `{ email, barangay: sys_id }`
- [ ] Handle the two response shapes from CLAUDE.md §5:
  - 201 with `"Subscribed successfully"` → success toast
  - Duplicate case `"Already subscribed"` → info toast "You're already on the list"
- [ ] Email validation client-side

> Note: actually **sending** the reminder emails is a ServiceNow-side scheduled job, outside frontend scope. Confirm with the ServiceNow admin that the job is configured.

---

### Milestone 2.9 — Analytics on Live Data (Day 6)

**Outcome:** Bar / Pie / Line charts render against real reports.

- [ ] `AdminAnalyticsPage` calls `getAllReports()` (no filters, all statuses) on mount
- [ ] Transform into chart data client-side:
  - **Bar:** group by `barangay` display value → count
  - **Pie:** group by `waste_type` → count
  - **Line:** group by `sys_created_on` date (last 30 days) → two series (Filed vs Resolved)
- [ ] Date range picker now actually filters the client-side dataset (not a stub)
- [ ] Handle empty states: "No reports yet in this range"
- [ ] Optional: cache the full reports fetch for 60s to avoid hammering the API when the user changes ranges

---

### Milestone 2.10 — Merged Schedule Page Data Fetch (Day 6)

**Outcome:** The resident `/schedule` page is now the single entry point for barangay-specific info. Selecting a barangay dynamically loads its schedule, assigned hauler, and route stops — the old standalone `/haulers` and `/route-map` pages no longer exist.

**Data flow on barangay select:**

Frontend fires three parallel calls through `services/api.js`:

1. `getSchedule(barangaySysId)` → `GET /schedules?barangay={sys_id}` — pickup days, time windows, waste types
2. `getHaulerByBarangay(barangaySysId)` → `GET /haulers?barangay={sys_id}` — hauler name, contact, vehicle info
3. `getRouteStops(barangaySysId)` → `GET /route-stops?barangay={sys_id}` — ordered stop list for the static route view

- [ ] Implement all three functions on top of `request()` (Milestone 2.1). Keep signatures stable so `ScheduleChecker` can swap mocks → real calls without structural changes.
- [ ] Use `Promise.all` on barangay change so the three panels load together. Per-panel skeletons while in flight.
- [ ] Handle partial failures: if one call fails (e.g., route stops 404 for a barangay with no route yet), render the other two panels and show an empty state in the failing one — never blank the whole page.
- [ ] Cache the last-selected barangay's payload in memory; if the user toggles back to it, don't refetch within 60s.
- [ ] Delete `src/pages/HaulersPage.jsx` and `src/pages/RouteMapPage.jsx` (and their routes in the router) if Phase 1 left them behind. Remove any sidebar/nav links to `/haulers` and `/route-map`.

**Acceptance:** On `/schedule`, pick Lahug → schedule table, hauler card, and route stop list all populate in one interaction. No `/haulers` or `/route-map` routes resolve (404 or redirect to `/schedule`).

---

### Milestone 2.11 — Error Handling & UX Polish (Day 7)

**Outcome:** Failures are graceful and informative, not blank screens.

- [ ] Centralized `useApi` hook wraps loading / error / data state for any async call. Every page uses it.
- [ ] 401 handling: if any call returns 401, trigger `logout()` and redirect to `/admin/login` with a "Session expired" flash
- [ ] 404 on `GET /reports/{code}` → Track page shows "No report found for that code"
- [ ] 500 / network errors → generic "Something went wrong, try again" toast + "Retry" button
- [ ] Loading skeletons on lists (not just spinners)
- [ ] Disable submit buttons while a POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE is in flight
- [ ] Accessibility pass: error messages are in `aria-live` regions

---

## Part D — Testing the Integration

### D.1 — Manual smoke test script

Team member runs through this in order on a fresh `npm run dev`:

1. Go to `/schedule`, pick Lahug → schedule, assigned hauler, and route stops all load in one view
2. Go to `/report`, submit a missed pickup for Lahug on today's date → receive a real `SC-2026-XXXX`
3. Copy the code, go to `/track`, enter it → see Pending
4. Log in as admin at `/admin/login`
5. In ReportsTable, find the new report → change status to "In Progress"
6. Open the resident tracker in another tab → within 10s, status flips to "In Progress" (polling)
7. Change to "Resolved" → tracker flips again
8. Create/assign a hauler to Lahug in admin HaulerManager → return to resident `/schedule`, reselect Lahug → new hauler shows in the hauler panel
9. Visit `/admin/analytics` → bar/pie/line charts all render with live counts
10. Log out → visiting `/admin/dashboard` redirects to login
11. Navigate directly to `/haulers` or `/route-map` → those routes no longer exist (redirect to `/schedule` or 404)

### D.2 — Backend direct verification

Test the API layer independent of UI with curl:

```bash
curl -u admin:PASSWORD https://dev375738.service-now.com/api/1986056/sugboclean_api/barangays
```

Should return 8 barangays. If not, Phase 2 can't proceed — fix auth / CORS / instance first.

---

## Part E — Definition of Done

Phase 2 is done when:

1. All 11 manual smoke-test steps in D.1 pass
2. `.env.local` is the only place the instance password appears (grep confirms)
3. `src/mocks/` is gone or gated for tests only
4. The browser Network tab shows one real call per user action (or one `Promise.all` burst for the merged `/schedule` page), no mocks
5. 401 / 404 / 500 each have a distinct, user-friendly UX path
6. Photo upload round-trips (submit a JPG, view the attachment in ServiceNow)
7. Admin status changes propagate to the tracker within 10 seconds
8. No page component imports from `mocks/` or `data/`
9. No `/haulers` or `/route-map` routes exist in the resident router; those files and nav links are deleted
10. `npm run build` succeeds with zero warnings from our code

---

## Part F — What Phase 2 Does **NOT** Include**

- ❌ OAuth / SSO for admins — still Basic Auth (Phase 3 security hardening)
- ❌ Real Leaflet map with live truck GPS — the route-stop list inside `/schedule` is still static text/markers (Phase 3)
- ❌ WebSocket push for status updates — still polling (Phase 3 optimization)
- ❌ Email reminder scheduler wiring — that's a ServiceNow-side scheduled job, not frontend
- ❌ Rate-limit / retry-with-backoff logic — add only if you observe real failures
- ❌ Bilingual Cebuano/English support — Phase 4

---

## Part G — Risks & Watch-outs

| Risk                                       | Mitigation                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CORS fails from local dev origin           | Use the NowSDK dev proxy; if standalone, add a CORS rule in ServiceNow                         |
| Business Rule not firing → no report code  | Check `sys_script_7ca70678...server.js` is deployed; verify in `sys_script.list` in the instance |
| Reference field shape breaks UI            | `normalizeRecord()` helper + a runtime assertion in dev mode                                  |
| Password leaks into git                    | `.gitignore` covers `.env.local`; add a pre-commit hook that greps for `VITE_SN_PASSWORD=`    |
| 401s on long sessions                      | On 401 → `logout()` + redirect flow already handles it; never loop on refresh                 |
| Attachment uploads exceed 5 MB             | Client-side size check + show clear error; server also enforces                                |
| CRUD forms send wrong field names          | Add a lightweight request schema check in `services/api.js` before POST/PUT                   |

---

## Part H — Handoff to Phase 3

Phase 3 scope after this ships:

- Real Leaflet map embedded in the `/schedule` route panel (replacing the static stop list)
- WebSocket / Server-Sent Events for status updates (replace polling)
- OAuth for admins
- Bilingual support (Cebuano / English)
- Offline caching of schedule data (PWA)

But **none of those are blockers for the pilot launch.** Phase 2 completion = SugboClean is usable by real Cebu residents and sanitation admins.

---

_End of Phase 2 Backend Integration Plan_
